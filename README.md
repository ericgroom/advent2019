# Advent of Code 2019
My solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2019/ written in Rust.

I've forgotten to do this every year until halfway through the month, so I'm glad I remembered on the first this year. I'm doing it in Rust because I've been trying to learn it for about 2 years now very casually and it's finally starting to click, and I'm hoping this challenge will help me become more comfortable with the language and standard library.

## How to run
1. Install the Rust compiler and cargo if you haven't already (this is the easiest method https://rustup.rs/)
2. run `cargo run` to see all of my answers for each day
3. run `cargo test` to run the test suite, which includes testing the final answers once I know the correct answer for the given input, as well as internal assertions for individual functions
